# Bank Simulation CSharp
 Simple bank simulation made in C#


 Can show generic command ("/help", "/program")
 Can create in runtime users, and allows them to have a bank account with money
 Can create bank in runtime (for now, bank can only be created one time ; in further update, the program will have the possibility to switch between bank)
 Every commands can add a handler, working with a dictionnary to output warning messages

 # To Do

 AST of all users
 Users hierarchy, where the top user can modify other and bottoms ones can't
 Colored syntaxes (because why not ?)
 Possibility to remove user
 Asynchronous operation for users, in runtime
